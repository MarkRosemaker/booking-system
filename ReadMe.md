Thanks for taking the time to connect earlier today, really appreciate it! I am delighted to let you know that I would like to move you forward in the process with us to complete the coding challenge attached in Golang. As I have mentioned, including tests and doing as much as you can what feels best for you, is what the team would like to see!

Please send me back the coding challenge at the end of day Tuesday, August 18th and I can share with the team to review and follow up with you on feedback and next possible steps!

rename "class" to course, instead a class is one day/session of the course.

TODO Use Restful standards and create the api endpoint with proper success and error responses.
